Problem Sets 
-------------

Each of the 10 topics we'll discuss has its own problem set, except Topics 7 and 8, which have a shared problem set. (Accordingly, there will be 9 problem sets in total.)

The problem sets count for 80% of the course grade.

_Collaboration Policy_

It's okay to discuss problem-sets with other MIT students who are currently taking the class, but each student must complete the problem-set on his or her own and include a list of collaborators. It's okay to consult published materials. With the exception of course-materials, all sources must be credited, in accordance with MIT's [Academic Integrity](https://integrity.mit.edu/) guidelines. (Consulting answers to problem sets from previous versions of the class is considered plagiarism and will be aggressively pursued.)
